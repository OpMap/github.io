Intuitively this step determines the `nationality` of every opinion and in particular this step partitions the vertices into so-called `clusters`, i.e. disjoint sets of vertices.   This resulting  partitioning  of the vertices into clusters is known as clustering.   Intuitively, in a good clustering the vertices of the same cluster are tightly connected to each other, while the connections between the vertices belonging to different clusters are much looser. 

[comment]: # (This is generically illustrated in \autoref{subfig:cluster}. It can be seen that vertices within each cluster, indicated by the dashed circles, are connected more densely than vertices belonging to different  clusters.)
