I'm a philosopher with interests in argumentation, formal models of reasoning, and philosophy of science.

I've been studying in Berlin, Paris and London and working in Berlin and Stuttgart, before taking up my current position at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

I am a **computer scientist**. I am passionate about **algorithms**, **graphs** and **visualizations**.  I am also a mathematician, so I **prove** facts about the algorithms I develop. Trying to keep in touch with reality though, I investigate how humans read and enjoy graph visualisations.

I grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia. I studied and obtained my PhD from National Technical University of Athens, Greece.  Since 2012 I live  with my husband and our little son in Karlsruhe, Germany. I work as a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics.

I'm a computer science student with a background in cognitive science. 

I'm interested in finding ways to make meaningful information out of data and to efficiently navigate through large amounts of human knowlegde by means of network analyses and visualisation techniques. Therefore I am happy for the chance to conclude my Master's degree with this interdisciplinary project.
