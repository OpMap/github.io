I'm a philosopher with interests in argumentation, formal models of reasoning, and philosophy of science.

I've been studying in Berlin, Paris and London and working in Berlin and Stuttgart, before taking up my current position at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

### Michael Hamann

I work as a doctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics. I work on graph algorithms, in particular finding clusters in graphs. My main focus is to make algorithms fast such that they can work with huge amounts of data. Apart from that I'm also very interested in practical applications of such algorithms like in this project.

I am a **computer scientist**. I am passionate about **algorithms**, **graphs** and **visualizations**.  I am a mathematician by training, thus I am used to **prove** facts about the algorithms I develop. Trying to keep in touch with reality though, I investigate how humans read and enjoy graph visualisations.

I grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia. I studied and obtained my PhD from National Technical University of Athens, Greece.  Since 2012 I live  with my husband and our little son in Karlsruhe, Germany. I work as a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics.

I'm a computer science student with a background in cognitive science. 

I'm interested in finding ways to extract meaningful information out of data and to efficiently navigate through large amounts of human knowlegde by means of network analysis and visualisation techniques. Therefore I am happy for the chance to conclude my Master's degree with this interdisciplinary project.
