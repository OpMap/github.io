I am a **computer scientist**. I am passionate about **algorithms**, **graphs** and **visualizations**.  I am also a mathematician, so I **prove** facts about the algorithms I develop. Trying to keep in touch with reality though, I investigate how humans read and enjoy graph visualisations.

I grew up in Tbilisi, Georgia. I studied and obtained my PhD from National Technical University of Athens, Greece.  Since 2012 I live  with my husband and our little son in Karlsruhe, Germany. I work as a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology at the Institute of Theoretical Informatics.
