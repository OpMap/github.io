It may be hard to grasp the variety of opinions on a complex issue. OpMAP helps to make sense of large opinion samples by visualizing them in form of a map. Most people are familiar with geographic maps and even enjoy examining them. OpMAP makes use of the map metaphor to create a highly intuitive visualization that readily unveils the opinion data and its underlying structure.

In order to apply OpMAP to a debate, opinions have to be elicited in a structured way. The simplest way to do this is by means of an online survey.

OpMAP takes as an input the results of such a survey and constructs a map of the opinions that are maintained by the participants of the survey. OpMAP is dynamic, so it continuously updates the opinion map as more people participate in the survey.

OpMAP can be applied to a debate and the corresponding survey on any topic of interest. The first application of OpMAP is on the debate about nutrition behaviors. As is well known, people may choose a certain diet for a variety of reasons  -- financial, culinary, ethical and health considerations, amongst others. As a result, there is a vast amount of opinions on eating habits. OpMAP provides a coarse overview on the variety of opinions present in the collected data.

<!-- The map shown above is purely hypothetical. It was drawn by hand as a first concept and is not based on real data. However, it illustrates important properties of the visualization: Similarity between opinions is captured by "geographical" distances in the map: People who share the same opinions on how a good diet looks like as well as the same reasons for their opinion) are part of the same "country". For example, opinions that advocate an omnivorous diet mostly for the pleasure experience of eating are "citizens" of *Hedonistica*, or opinions that advocate a vegan diet because they hold that animals have a right to life are found in *Ethica*. Furthermore, the size of the countries and the labels roughly reflect the structure of the underlying "opinion space". The more opinions exist
that represent the same general eating behaviour, the bigger the area of the corresponding country. The font size of the labels is adjusted according to some
notion of importance, for example the number of "inhabitants". -->

Our work was inspired by [GMap](http://yifanhu.net/MAPS/index.html), a visualisation algorithm and tool by Stephen Kouborov and colleagues from the University of Arizona.
