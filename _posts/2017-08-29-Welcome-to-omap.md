It is hard to grasp the variety of opinions that are advocated in a debate, as well as relationships between them, if they are presented in textual form as a dialogue or the like. OpMap is a tool that helps to make sense of large ongoing debates, by visualizing them in form of a map. Most people are  familiar with geographic maps and even enjoy examining them. OpMAP makes use of the geography metaphor to create a highly intuitive visualization that readily unveils the data and its underlying structure.

In order to apply OpMap to a debate, it has to be structured as an online survey. 
OpMap takes as an input the results of such a survey and constructs a map of the opinions that are formed by the participants in the survey. OpMAP is dynamic, so it continuously updates the opinion map as people participate in the survey. 

OpMAP can be applied to a debate and the corresponding survey on any topic of interest. The first application of OpMAP is on the debate about nutrition behaviors. As we all know, people may choose a certain diet for a variety of reasons  -- financial, culinary, ethical and health, amongst others. As a result, there is a vast amount of opinions on eating habits. OpMAP provides a coarse overview on the variety of opinions present in the collected data. 

The scientific methodology behind the construction of the opinion map is described [`here`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/methodology.md %}). Check [`veggie-debate`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/veggie-debate.md %}) for the description of the opinion map on nutrition behaviors.
