There is an ongoing debate about nutrition behaviours. People may choose a certain diet for a variety of reasons  -- financial, culinary, ethical and health, amongst others.
As a result, there is a vast amount of opinions on eating habits. It is hard to grasp the variety of opinions that are advocated in a debate, as well as relationships between them, if they are presented in textual form as a dialogue or the like. In order to make sense of these data we suggest to visualize them in form of a map. Most people are  familiar with geographic maps and even enjoy examining them. We aim to make use of the geography metaphor to create a highly intuitive visualization that readily unveils the data and its underlying structure.
Such an opinion map, in case of the "Veggie Debate", could look as shown in figure.
